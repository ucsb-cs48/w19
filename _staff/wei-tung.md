bio: >
   My name is Wei Tung. I'm currently a third year computer science major. I have done numerous mobile (Android)
   and website application projects and internships over the past few years. I have not decided what topic I'll
   focus on in the future but currently I enjoy writing applications, doing data analysis projects, and maybe some
   machine learning. Coming from a music background, I also want to do some music/audio data analysis projects to
   understand its psychological influence to people and their culture. But besides coding, I like listening to music,
   playing Wii, "basic" cooking, photography, and eat.
