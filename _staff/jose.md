bio: >
    My name is Jose Cuellar. I am a third year Computer Science student. I enjoy working on mobile application (mostly on           Android). As for my experience with cs48, I worked on a ride-sharing mobile application for UCSB students using the React       Native framework (unfortunately never published). In my free time I enjoy to play video games, create my own games, and         look at memes.
