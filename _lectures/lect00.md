# Announcements

* Sorry, no crashers: enrollment is final
* Must attend your actual enrolled discussion section
   * And work with folks enrolled in that section
* [Open lab hours schedule]({{ '/info/open_lab_hours' | relative_url}})


# Goals

* You'll meet several of your classmates that you haven't met before
* You'll generate and evaluate some project ideas

Today, we'll divide into discussion sections, and do some activities that will help with team formation and project idea generation:

We will do these activities in three groups of 26, by discussion section.

# Instructor Instructions

## Seating arrangement

Divide chairs first into separate sections of the room, by discussion section.

Then, arrange students so that you can acheive a kind of "speed dating" setup, where the students in one set of chairs stays stationary, while the students in the other set rotate every 5-10 minutes.

Then, WITHIN each discussion section, arrange chairs into any 
* two rows facing each other (e.g. for 26 students, 13 pairs of chairs facing each other)
* multiple rows facing each other (e.g. for 26 students, one row of 6 pairs of chairs facing each other (12 students) and another of 7 pairs of chairs facing each other (14 students)
* an outer circle and and inner circle (this is the best arrangement, but may require more space than the space available; inner circle might get too cramped)

## Initial writing activity (done in silence)

The initial writing activity is done individually, in silence, with no discussion.

It is to come up with a project idea.

## Subsequent activity

In this activity, students swap project ideas and THEN rotate once.   
* Each pair of students now holds a project idea different from the one they or the person initially across from them wrote.  
* They then discuss the project ideas they now hold with each other.
* They also do a brief interview with each other.
* They write down the results of these interactions, including both a rating of the project idea
* And then they iterate; swapping project ideas, and rotating AGAIN

Repeat this 5 times, so that each project idea has been rated and reviewed 5 times.
