# More about Procore

From the [procore.com](https://procore.com) website 

What the company does:
> Procore is a leading provider of cloud-based applications for construction. Procore connects people, applications, and devices through a unified platform to help construction professionals manage risk and build quality projects—safely, on time, and within budget. Procore has a diversified business model with products for Project Management, Construction Financials, Quality & Safety, and Field Productivity. Headquartered in Carpinteria, California, with offices around the globe, Procore is used to manage billions of dollars in annual construction volume. 

Technologies they use to do that:
> Our tech stack is Ruby / Rails / Postgres, with a few microservices in Rust and Elixir, where we need to focus on high concurrency and performance. We have overhauled our front end to implement ReactJS and Redux. Our mobile apps provide access to many of Procore's tools on iOS, Android and Windows.

# Topics 

* Amir and Jason will discuss QA in general, and acceptance testing for issues/user stories in particular
   * I'm also hopeful they might talk about testing and code review processes at Procore
* Heidi and I will have a brief Q&A conversation about Agile/Scrum/Lean/Kanban and the importance of Teamwork skills
* We'll also incorporate time for a brief standup; please make that standup very efficient on time so we maximize our time with Amir, Jason and Heidi.
