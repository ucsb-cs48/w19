Read the material at the following web page. It's relatively short.
* <https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories>

Also read these four pages to which it links.  Each of them is also relatively short.

* [Advantages of the “As a user, I want” user story template](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/advantages-of-the-as-a-user-i-want-user-story-template)
* [A Sample Format for a Spreadsheet-Based Product Backlog](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/a-sample-format-for-a-spreadsheet-based-product-backlog)
* [Advantages of User Stories for Requirements](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/articles/advantages-of-user-stories-for-requirements)
* [Non-functional Requirements as User Stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/non-functional-requirements-as-user-stories)

You are also strongly encouraged (though not required for this homework assignment) to watch this video:
* [Introduction to User Stories (52 minute video)](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/presentations/introduction-to-user-stories).   You will be required to watch it for a later assignment, so you might as well watch it now if you have the time.

Then answer these questions:

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> One application that each of you has used in order to be in this class is UCSB's GOLD system, the system used to register for classes.  Give three examples of user stories, using the suggested form: As a `___` I can `___` so that `___`.

If necessary, review the reading about this recommended form so that you understand what should go in each blank.

<b>For full credit: include at least two different roles in your list, not only the role of being a student.</b>  Though you have likely only interacted with GOLD in the role of a student, imagine, also, the role that the staff in, say the CS department might have when adding courses to the schedule, giving out add codes, and other things that staff do regarding registration.

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> As the readings describe, the user story starts with "As a `___` I can `___` so that `___`", but does not end there.   The bigger picture is sometimes described this way: card, conversation, confirmation.

Briefly describe what each of these means:
